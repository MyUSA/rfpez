Hey <?= $user->vendor->company_name ?>,

Thanks for signing up for RFP-EZ, and for being one of the first to participate in this exciting pilot program.

In the coming weeks, we'll be adding more and more government projects that are looking for proposals from businesses like yours. If you checked the box during sign-up, we'll send you notices about these from time-to-time.

We think there are some great synergies where we can help government gain access to the awesome services you provide, while also opening up a whole new market to your business.

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to reply to this email or tweet at @ProjectRFPEZ. And thanks again for signing up for our pilot!
